Retrieve data We will be working with data from: Clark, M. B. et al (2020). Long-read sequencing reveals the complex splicing profile of the psychiatric risk gene CACNA1C in human brain . Molecular Psychiatry, 25(1), 37\u201347. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-019-0583-1 The authors used full-transcript amplicon sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technology of CACNA1C, a gene associated with psychiatric risk. For the exercises of today, we will work with a single sample of this study. Download and unpack the data files in your home directory. cd ~/workdir wget https://ngs-longreads-training.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ngs-longreads-training.tar.gz tar -xvf ngs-longreads-training.tar.gz rm ngs-longreads-training.tar.gz Exercise: This will create the directory data . Check out what\u2019s in there. Answer Go to the ~/workdir/data folder: cd ~/data The data folder contains the following: data/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 reads \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 cerebellum-5238-batch2.fastq.gz \u2514\u2500\u2500 reference \u2514\u2500\u2500 Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa 2 directories, 2 files In the reads folder a fastq file with reads, in the reference folder the reference sequence. 2. Quality control We will evaluate the read quality with NanoPlot . Exercise: Check out the manual of NanoPlot with the command NanoPlot --help , and run NanoPlot on ~/data/reads/cerebellum-5238-batch2.fastq.gz . Hint For a basic output of NanoPlot on a fastq.gz file you can use the options --outdir and --fastq . Answer We have a fastq file, so based on the manual and the example we can run: cd ~/workdir NanoPlot \\ --fastq data/reads/cerebellum-5238-batch2.fastq.gz \\ --outdir nanoplot_output You will now have a directory with the following files: nanoplot_output \u251c\u2500\u2500 LengthvsQualityScatterPlot_dot.html \u251c\u2500\u2500 LengthvsQualityScatterPlot_dot.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 LengthvsQualityScatterPlot_kde.html \u251c\u2500\u2500 LengthvsQualityScatterPlot_kde.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 NanoPlot-report.html \u251c\u2500\u2500 NanoPlot_20230309_1332.log \u251c\u2500\u2500 NanoStats.txt \u251c\u2500\u2500 Non_weightedHistogramReadlength.html \u251c\u2500\u2500 Non_weightedHistogramReadlength.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 Non_weightedLogTransformed_HistogramReadlength.html \u251c\u2500\u2500 Non_weightedLogTransformed_HistogramReadlength.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 WeightedHistogramReadlength.html \u251c\u2500\u2500 WeightedHistogramReadlength.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 WeightedLogTransformed_HistogramReadlength.html \u251c\u2500\u2500 WeightedLogTransformed_HistogramReadlength.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 Yield_By_Length.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 Yield_By_Length.png The file NanoPlot-report.html contains a report with all the information stored in the other files. Exercise: Download NanoPlot-report.html to your local computer and answer the following questions: A. How many reads are in the file? B. What is the average read length? Is there a wide distribution? Given that these sequences are generated from a long-range PCR, is that expected? C. What is the average base quality and what kind of accuracy do we therefore expect? Download files from the notebook You can download files from the file browser, by right-clicking a file and selecting Download : Answer A. 3735 B. The average read length is 6,003.3 base pairs. From the read length histogram we can see that there is a very narrow distribution. As a PCR will generate sequences of approximately the same length, this is expected. C. The average base quality is 7.3. We have learned that \\(p=10^{\\frac{-baseQ}{10}}\\) , so the average probability that the base is wrong is \\(10^{\\frac{-7.3}{10}} = 0.186\\) . The expected accuracy is \\(1-0.186=0.814\\) or 81.4%. 3. Read alignment The sequence aligner minimap2 is specifically developed for (splice-aware) alignment of long reads. Exercise: Checkout the helper minimap2 --help and/or the github readme . We are working with reads generated from cDNA. Considering we are aligning to a reference genome (DNA), what would be the most logical parameter for our dataset to the option -x ? Answer The option -x can take the following arguments: -x STR preset (always applied before other options; see minimap2.1 for details) [] - map-pb/map-ont: PacBio/Nanopore vs reference mapping - ava-pb/ava-ont: PacBio/Nanopore read overlap - asm5/asm10/asm20: asm-to-ref mapping, for ~0.1/1/5% sequence divergence - splice: long-read spliced alignment - sr: genomic short-read mapping We are working with ONT data so we could choose map-ont . However, our data is also spliced. Therefore, we should choose splice . Introns can be quite long in mammals; up to a few hundred kb. Exercise: Look up the CACNA1C gene in hg38 in IGV, and roughly estimate the length of the longest intron. Hint First load hg38 in IGV, by clicking the topleft drop-down menu: After that type CACNA1C in the search box: Answer The longest intron is about 350 kilo bases (350,000 base pairs) Exercise: Check out the -G option of minimap2 . How does this relate to the the largest intron size of CACNA1C? Answer This is what the manual says: -G NUM max intron length (effective with -xsplice; changing -r) [200k] We found an intron size of approximately 350k, so the default is set too small. We should be increase it to at least 350k. Exercise: Make a directory called alignments in your working directory. After that, modify the command below for minimap2 and run it from a script. #!/usr/bin/env bash cd ~/workdir minimap2 \\ -a \\ -x [ PARAMETER ] \\ -G [ PARAMETER ] \\ -t 4 \\ data/reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa \\ data/reads/cerebellum-5238-batch2.fastq.gz \\ | samtools sort \\ | samtools view -bh > alignments/cerebellum-5238-batch2.bam ## indexing for IGV samtools index alignments/cerebellum-5238-batch2.bam Note Once your script is running, it will take a while to finish. Have a \u2615. Answer Make a directory like this: mkdir ~/workdir/alignments Modify the script to set the -x and -G options: #!/usr/bin/env bash cd ~/workdir minimap2 \\ -a \\ -x splice \\ -G 500k \\ -t 4 \\ data/reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa \\ data/reads/cerebellum-5238-batch2.fastq.gz \\ | samtools sort \\ | samtools view -bh > alignments/cerebellum-5238-batch2.bam ## indexing for IGV samtools index alignments/cerebellum-5238-batch2.bam And run it (e.g. if you named the script ont_alignment.sh ): chmod u+x ont_alignment.sh ./ont_alignment.sh 4. Visualisation Let\u2019s have a look at the alignments. Download the files cerebellum-5238-batch2.bam and cerebellum-5238-batch2.bam.bai to your local computer and load the .bam file into IGV ( File > Load from File\u2026 ). Exercise: Have a look at the region chr12:2,632,655-2,635,447 by typing it into the search box. Do you see any evidence for alternative splicing already?

Copy-paste the link (including the port, e.g.: http://12.345.789.10:10002 ) in your browser. This should result in the following page: Type your password, and proceed to the notebook home page. This page contains all the files in your working directory (if there are any). Most of the exercises will be executed through the command line. We use the terminal for this. Find it at New > Terminal : For a.o. efficiency and reproducibility it makes sense to execute your commands from a script. You can generate and edit scripts with New > Text File : Once you have opened a script you can change the code highlighting. This is convenient for writing the code. The text editor will automatically change the highlighting based on the file extension (e.g. .py extension will result in python syntax highlighting). You can change or set the syntax highlighting by clicking the button on the bottom of the page. We will be using mainly shell scripting in this course, so here\u2019s an example for adjusting it to shell syntax highlighting: Material Instructions to install docker Instructions to set up to container Exercises First login Docker can be used to run an entire isolated environment in a container. This means that we can run the software with all its dependencies required for this course locally in your computer. Independent of your operating system. In the video below there\u2019s a tutorial on how to set up a docker container for this course. Note that you will need administrator rights, and that if you are using Windows, you need the latest version of Windows 10. The command to run the environment required for this course looks like this (in a terminal): Modify the script Modify the path after -v to the working directory on your computer before running it. docker run \\ --rm \\ -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB = yes \\ -v /path/to/workingdir/:/home/jovyan \\ -p 8888 :8888 \\ geertvangeest/ngs-longreads-jupyter:latest \\ start-notebook.sh If this command has run successfully, you will find a link and token in the console, e.g.: http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token = 4be8d916e89afad166923de5ce5th1s1san3xamp13 Copy this URL into your browser, and you will be able to use the jupyter notebook. The option -v mounts a local directory in your computer to the directory /home/jovyan in the docker container (\u2018jovyan\u2019 is the default user for jupyter containers). In that way, you have files available both in the container and on your computer. Use this directory on your computer to e.g. visualise data with IGV. Change the first path to a path on your computer that you want to use as a working directory. Don\u2019t mount directly in the home dir Don\u2019t directly mount your local directory to the home directory ( /root ). This will lead to unexpected behaviour. The part geertvangeest/ngs-longreads-jupyter:latest is the image we are going to load into the container. The image contains all the information about software and dependencies needed for this course. When you run this command for the first time it will download the image. Once it\u2019s on your computer, it will start immediately. If you have a conda installation on your local computer, you can install the required software using conda. You can build the environment from ngs-longreads.yml Generate the conda environment like this: conda env create --name ngs-longreads -f ngs-longreads.yml The yaml file probably only works for Linux systems If you want to use the conda environment on a different OS, use: conda create -n ngs-longreads python = 3 .6 conda activate ngs-longreads conda install -y -c bioconda \\ samtools \\ minimap2 \\ fastqc \\ pbmm2 \\ conda install -y -c bioconda nanoplot If the installation of NanoPlot fails, try to install it with pip : pip install NanoPlot This will create the conda environment ngs-longreads Activate it like so: conda activate ngs-longreads After successful installation and activating the environment all the software required to do the exercises should be available. A UNIX command line interface (CLI) refresher Most bioinformatics software are UNIX based and are executed through the CLI. When working with NGS data, it is therefore convenient to improve your knowledge on UNIX. For this course, we need basic understanding of UNIX CLI, so here are some exercises to refresh your memory. Make a new directory Login to the server and use the command line to make a directory called workdir . If working with Docker If your are working with docker you are a root user. This means that your \u201chome\u201d directory is the root directory, i.e. /root , and not /home/username . If you have mounted your local directory to /root/workdir , this directory should already exist. Answer cd mkdir workdir Make a directory scripts within ~/workdir and make it your current directory. Answer cd workdir mkdir scripts cd scripts File permissions Generate an empty script in your newly made directory ~/workdir/scripts like this: touch new_script.sh Add a command to this script that writes \u201cSIB courses are great!\u201d (or something you can better relate to.. ) to stdout, and try to run it. Answer The script should look like this: #!/usr/bin/env bash echo \"SIB courses are great!\" Usually, you can run it like this: ./new_script.sh But there\u2019s an error: bash: ./new_script.sh: Permission denied Why is there an error? Hint Use ls -lh new_script.sh to check the permissions. Answer ls -lh new_script.sh gives: -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 51B Nov 11 16 :21 new_script.sh There\u2019s no x in the permissions string. You should change at least the permissions of the user. Make the script executable for yourself, and run it. Answer Change permissions: chmod u+x new_script.sh ls -lh new_script.sh now gives: -rwxr--r-- 1 user group 51B Nov 11 16:21 new_script.sh So it should be executable: ./new_script.sh More on chmod and file permissions here . Redirection: > and | In the root directory (go there like this: cd / ) there are a range of system directories and files. Write the names of all directories and files to a file called system_dirs.txt in your working directory ( ~/workdir ; use ls and > ). Answer ls / > ~/workdir/system_dirs.txt The command wc -l counts the number of lines, and can read from stdin. Make a one-liner with a pipe | symbol to find out how many system directories and files there are. Answer ls / | wc -l Variables Store system_dirs.txt as variable (like this: VAR=variable ), and use wc -l on that variable to count the number of lines in the file. Answer cd ~/workdir FILE = system_dirs.txt wc -l $FILE shell scripts Make a shell script that automatically counts the number of system directories and files. Answer Make a script called e.g. current_system_dirs.sh : #!/usr/bin/env bash cd / ls | wc -l Loops 20 minutes If you want to run the same command on a range of arguments, it\u2019s not very convenient to type the command for each individual argument. For example, you could write dog , fox , bird to stdout in a script like this: #!/usr/bin/env bash echo dog echo fox echo bird However, if you want to change the command (add an option for example), you would have to change it for all the three command calls. Amongst others for that reason, you want to write the command only once. You can do this with a for-loop, like this: #!/usr/bin/env bash ANIMALS = \"dog fox bird\" for animal in $ANIMALS do echo $animal done Which results in: dog fox bird Write a shell script that removes all the letters \u201ce\u201d from a list of words. Hint Removing the letter \u201ce\u201d from a string can be done with tr like this: word = \"test\" echo $word | tr -d \"e\" Which would result in: tst Answer Your script should e.g. look like this (I\u2019ve added some awesome functionality): #!/usr/bin/env bash WORDLIST = \"here is a list of words resulting in a sentence\" for word in $WORDLIST do echo \"' $word ' with e's removed looks like:\" echo $word | tr -d \"e\" done resulting in: 'here' with e's removed looks like: hr 'is' with e's removed looks like: is 'a' with e's removed looks like: a 'list' with e's removed looks like: list 'of' with e's removed looks like: of 'words' with e's removed looks like: words 'resulting' with e's removed looks like: rsulting 'in' with e's removed looks like: in 'a' with e's removed looks like: a 'sentence' with e's removed looks like: sntnc","title":"Server login"},{"location":"course_material/server_login/#learning-outcomes","text":"Note You might already be able to do some or all of these learning outcomes.

Because some intermediate files are already given, participants can develop scripts/analyses at different steps of the full analysis from the start. Possible starting points are: Quality control, running fastqc and NanoPlot Alignment, running minimap2 Develop scripts required to run FLAIR Differential expression analysis. Tasks & questions Perform QC with fastqc and with NanoPlot . Do you see a difference between them? How is the read quality compared to the publication? Align each sample separately with minimap2 with default parameters. Set parameters -x and -G to the values we have used during the QC and alignment exercises . You can use 4 threads (set the number of threads with -t ) Start the alignment as soon as possible The alignment takes about 6 minutes per sample, so in total about one hour to run. Try to start the alignment as soon as possible. You can speed up your alignment by first making an index, e.g.: minimap2 \\ -x splice \\ -d reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa.mmi \\ reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa Refer to the generated index ( .mmi file) as reference in the alignment command, e.g.: minimap2 \\ -a \\ -x splice \\ -G 500k \\ -t 4 \\ reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa.mmi \\ reads/<my_reads.fastq.gz> Have a look at the FLAIR documentation . FLAIR and all its dependencies are in the the pre-installed conda environment named flair . You can activate it with conda activate flair . Merge the separate alignments with samtools merge , index the merged bam file, and generate a bed12 file with the command bam2Bed12 Run flair correct on the bed12 file. Add the gtf to the options to improve the alignments. Run flair collapse to generate isoforms from corrected reads. This steps takes ~1.5 hours to run. Generate a count matrix with flair quantify by using the isoforms fasta and reads_manifest.tsv (takes ~45 mins to run). Paths in reads_manifest.tsv The paths in reads_manifest.tsv are relative, e.g. reads/striatum-5238-batch2.fastq.gz points to a file relative to the directory from which you are running flair quantify . So the directory from which you are running the command should contain the directory reads . If not, modify the paths in the file accordingly (use full paths if you are not sure). Now you can do several things: Do a differential expression analysis. In scripts/ there\u2019s a basic R script to do the analysis. Go to your specified IP and port to login to RStudio server (the username is rstudio ).

Do you see a difference between them? How is the read quality compared to the publication? Align each sample separately with minimap2 with default parameters. Set parameters -x and -G to the values we have used during the QC and alignment exercises . You can use 4 threads (set the number of threads with -t ) Start the alignment as soon as possible The alignment takes about 6 minutes per sample, so in total about one hour to run. Try to start the alignment as soon as possible. You can speed up your alignment by first making an index, e.g.: minimap2 \\ -x splice \\ -d reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa.mmi \\ reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa Refer to the generated index ( .mmi file) as reference in the alignment command, e.g.: minimap2 \\ -a \\ -x splice \\ -G 500k \\ -t 4 \\ reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.12.fa.mmi \\ reads/<my_reads.fastq.gz> Have a look at the FLAIR documentation . FLAIR and all its dependencies are in the the pre-installed conda environment named flair . You can activate it with conda activate flair . Merge the separate alignments with samtools merge , index the merged bam file, and generate a bed12 file with the command bam2Bed12 Run flair correct on the bed12 file. Add the gtf to the options to improve the alignments. Run flair collapse to generate isoforms from corrected reads. This steps takes ~1.5 hours to run. Generate a count matrix with flair quantify by using the isoforms fasta and reads_manifest.tsv (takes ~45 mins to run). Paths in reads_manifest.tsv The paths in reads_manifest.tsv are relative, e.g. reads/striatum-5238-batch2.fastq.gz points to a file relative to the directory from which you are running flair quantify . So the directory from which you are running the command should contain the directory reads . If not, modify the paths in the file accordingly (use full paths if you are not sure). Now you can do several things: Do a differential expression analysis. In scripts/ there\u2019s a basic R script to do the analysis.
