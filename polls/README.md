## README for polls

In this directory you can find the polls used during the course. They are referenced in the presentations. The format is json. We use [vevox](https://www.vevox.com/) for hosting polls, and the json files can be directly imported into vevox. Make sure to zip the json first before importing:

```sh
zip polls.zip polls.json
```
